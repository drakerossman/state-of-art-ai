This project aims to provide the snapshot of the State of Art AI models which you can run locally. It also aims to provide extensive model data categorization, filtering and search capabilities.

Think **Hugging Face X PCPartPicker = Geizhals for AI Models**.

Right now the website supports just the basic functionality, but expect more to come in the nearest future, and for that check out the [Project's Roadmap](https://github.com/users/drakerossman/projects/1/views/1?visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C%22Status%22%2C%22Milestone%22%5D).

Contributions are extremely welcome, especially any help to categorize and classify the models, their backends, and frontends.
